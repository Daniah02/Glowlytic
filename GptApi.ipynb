    "### Generative AI Overview:\n",
    "**Generative AI** is a type of **artificial intelligence** that can produce original content—such as text, images, audio, or code—based on user prompts. It uses deep learning models that mimic human cognitive processes to detect patterns in massive datasets and generate relevant outputs in response to natural language inputs. [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### How can Generative AI enhance our system?\n",
    "In this assignment, we integrate **Generative AI** into our skincare recommendation system using ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI. [2]\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT (short for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) processes user inputs like skin type and desired skincare effects to produce personalized product advice. This makes it a powerful tool for recommendation systems, where user-specific data can be interpreted in real time to generate tailored outputs without relying on fixed decision trees or manually curated product lists. By leveraging ChatGPT's natural language understanding capabilities, the system becomes more adaptive, scalable, and capable of engaging users in a conversational interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Effectiveness of Prompts\n",
    "The sentences or questions that you enter into a **Generative AI** tool, also known as prompts, greatly affect the quality of outputs you receive. After you enter a prompt, the model analyzes the input and generates a response based on the patterns it has learned through its training. Descriptive prompts can enhance the quality of the outputs. [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "By experimenting with two different prompt templates, we explore how variations in prompt detail influence the quality and specificity of AI-generated recommendations. This allows us to compare and justify the effectiveness of each template in delivering clear, useful, and user-centered skincare suggestions. [4]\n"

      " I would recommend a oil-free or water-based gel cleanser specifically formulated for oily and acne-prone skin. These types of cleansers are designed to effectively remove excess oil, dirt, and impurities from the skin without clogging pores or causing further breakouts. They often contain ingredients like salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide, which can help to target acne-causing bacteria and reduce inflammation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, gel cleansers have a lightweight and refreshing texture that won't leave behind a greasy residue on the skin, making them ideal for those with oily skin. Using a gel cleanser consistently can help to control excess oil production, prevent future breakouts, and promote clearer, healthier skin overall.\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Template 2 Response ===\n",
      " For someone with oily skin looking for anti-acne products within a price range of around 150 SAR, I would recommend a cleanser as the first step in their skincare routine. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would specifically recommend a cleanser that contains salicylic acid as the main ingredient. Salicylic acid is a beta hydroxy acid that can penetrate deep into the pores to help remove excess oil, dirt, and dead skin cells that can lead to acne breakouts. It also has anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce redness and swelling associated with acne.\n",
      "\n",
      "A salicylic acid cleanser is ideal for oily skin types because it can help regulate sebum production and prevent clogged pores, which are common issues for those with oily skin. By using a salicylic acid cleanser regularly, the user can effectively cleanse their skin, prevent breakouts, and improve the overall appearance of their skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, salicylic acid is generally well-tolerated by most skin types, making it a safe and effective option for those with oily and acne-prone skin. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, a salicylic acid cleanser would be a great choice for someone with oily skin looking for anti-acne products within a budget-friendly price range. It can effectively target acne-causing factors, regulate oil production, and improve the overall health and appearance of the skin.\n"
