    "Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the most notable supervised machine learning algorithms, it was designed to classify data by finding the most ideal boundary between different attributes. Unlike some other models that might get distracted by noise or additional details, SVM focuses on the most important data points which are the ones that are closest to the boundary to ensure that the systems decisions are made in a clear and precise way. By maximizing the margin between categories, SVM improves accuracy and make classification task reliable."

    "#### Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose to implement SVM because of the following reasons: \n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tThe Glowlytic recommendation system takes into consideration multiple attributes, including skin type, product type, brand, and notable effects. Also, SVMâ€™s ability to work well in high-dimensional spaces makes sure that all these factors are taken into account for accurate recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tSince our system relies on a curated datasets and a massive amount of data, SVM makes an ideal choice. It promises high accuracy even with a smaller dataset, and outperforms other models that need extensive training data to be effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tUnlike models that may struggle with new inputs, SVM has balance by having clear decision boundaries. This makes it have less tendency to overfit  and ensures that recommendations remain the same across different users."
