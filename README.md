## 🎯 Motivation
Many people struggle to choose the right skincare products due to the **overwhelming number of options** available on the market. The main challenges include:  
✅ **Diverse Skin Concerns:** Acne, dryness, wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, sensitivity, and more.  
✅ **Too Many Choices:** Thousands of products make selection difficult.  
✅ **Generic Recommendations:** Many suggestions do not consider individual skin needs.  

Our motivation for this project is to build a **personalized, intelligent skincare recommendation system** that suggests products based on user inputs, helping users make better-informed skincare decisions.
